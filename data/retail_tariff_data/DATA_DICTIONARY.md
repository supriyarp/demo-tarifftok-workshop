# üìä Data Dictionary - Retail Tariff Datasets

This document describes all datasets generated for tariff and retail scenario planning analysis.

## üéØ **Recent Updates for Realism (2024)**

**All data has been updated to reflect realistic shipping and supply chain patterns:**

- **Lead Times**: Now reflect actual geographic proximity (Mexico: 3-4 days, USA: 1.5-3 days, Asia: 19-28 days)
- **Freight Costs**: Distance-based pricing with proximity advantages (Mexico: 65% reduction, USA: 80% reduction)
- **Quality Scores**: Realistic distribution across countries with at least 2 suppliers having poor quality (score 1)
- **Transit vs Lead Time**: Separated pure transportation time from total lead time (includes processing)
- **Processing Times**: Added realistic customs and documentation delays by country

### Risk Level Definitions:
- **Low** ‚Üí Suppliers are generally dependable with fewer disruptions
- **Medium** ‚Üí There's some uncertainty, such as possible delays or constraints
- **High** ‚Üí A higher chance of supply problems, like delays, shortages, or quality issues
